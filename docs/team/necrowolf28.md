### Project: PlaceBook

PlaceBook (PB) is a desktop app for managing contacts and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).** If you can type fast, PB can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `findTags`
    * What it does: allows the user to find contacts with tags that match the given keyword(s).
    * Justification: This is an important feature if users want to create appointments with groups of people with the same
      tags, for example people from the same company.
    * Credits: the implementation is largely similar to the AB-3 find feature.

* **New Feature**: `editApp`
    * What it does: allows the user to edit at least one field in an existing appointment.
    * Justification: This is an important feature if users want to edit an appointment without having to delete the existing
      one and creating a new one.
    * Credits: the implementation is slightly similar to the AB-3 edit feature, but includes important additions as well.

* **New Feature**: `delApp`
    * What it does: allows the user to delete an existing application based on its index shown on the app.
    * Justification: This is a must-have feature for users to delete appointments.
    * Credits: the implementation is slightly similar to the AB-3 delete feature, but includes important additions as well.
